How to get a mentor
-- her story of how she did it
Ell Marquez (Community Architect)

Who is in the room because they need it as much as you do?
-- see: "when you want it as bad you want to breathe"
-- find the key people in the room vs. who just kinda wants it
-- someone paid for her cert test
	-- do this for other people too

6 weeks
-- nothing -> Linux, Apache, MySQL -> cert gained
Then they went on to be Red Hat Certified Sys Admins

Stay connected to those communities you came up through

She went through "Rackspace" company
She's working through serious inferiority thoughts, imposter syndrome
She started having fun at work again, when someone started putting into her

What is Linux Academy?

Westward Ho by Samuel Beckett (a book she read)
-- might have mispelled that

Stop looking for a mentor
-- look for teachers
	-- you can't force a teaching relationship where it isn't there
Ask questions
-- literally, even push yourself out of your comfort zone by asking for directions or things at the store
	-- then ask more questions
	-- *is there anything I didn't ask that you think I should've?*
Understand what your ask is
-- make your specific ask, keep the constraints you set (value their time!)

SMART goals
-- specific, measurable, attainable, realistic, time-bound
	-- how do you know if it's "realistic"? -> is it "relevent"; use that word
-- (*dave Ramsey says the same thing about goals*)

Go learn something, go hit a wall, *then* look for a mentor

How she got on OpenStack
-- A series of vulnerable moments
-- Asking for help
-- The opportunity showed up

- honest
- vulnerable
