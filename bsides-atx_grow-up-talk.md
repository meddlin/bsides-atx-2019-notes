What do I want to be when I grow up?
Damon J. Small, Technical Director
"ch3f"
NCCGroup


History of infosec
- used to be just a side thing to production support
	- updating softwar ewas primitive
- when did it start
	- NCC Group 1999
	- DEF CON 1993
	- SATAN 1995 (one of the firsts) the commercial product was SAINT? (1998)
	- all the way to TrustedSec in 2012
- there wasn't the idea of dedicated "security professionals" in the beginning

Damon went
- studied music -> recording studio -> tech demands
- then...experience -> training -> more education -> ...and repeat

Think about Groundhog Day (the movie)
- don't do the same year of work, 20 times
- leave your comfort zone
- have a support network including mentors
	- doesn't have to be someone older than you

We unfaily expect a high level of knowledge/expertise based on the letters in the cert
- we should expect "the lowest bar of knowledge in order to pass the exam"

Education
- even if what you're doing isn't directly related to your education, it's still useful
- referenced the "guy (Story) who put the glasses on the Hubble telescope" for this point, he has a bunch of degrees
	- this astronaut supposedly gives extraordinary interviews

Case study
- student, 4 year degree
- assumed only way to infosec was via IT
- then found that to not be true
- "I wish I'd done defense first."
- "[gets] better at app assessments by actually building software."
- ...experence is the the most useful things for him. Every time he takes a test, he gets more turned off to formal training

- business owner, mid career
- straight to IT after undergrad, then MBA later
- "no clear path" to sysadmin
- grad school led to managmeent
- management led to starting own infosec firm
- "If .com bust didn't happen...I wouldn't have went to business school"
	- it made him want to take a more holistic view
- His English degree was based in critical thinking and analyzing written work...creative people tend to excel in infosec.
- "almost always credential-sepcific because of PCI audits"--so he makes his money based on the credentials
- There is a difference between credential training and applied training

- went to sysadmins immediately after college
- stumbled into infosec (Nimda and Code Red happened)
- discovered "incident response"
- also had business undergrad, MBA
- "protect to enable" -- protecting information assets to enable something to happen in a business (so it's screwing things down to make your job harder)
- harder not for "business to understand tech" but for "him to understand the business as he is a part of tech"
- enjoys certs since it exposes one to new things and information

- chose a "stupid route"
- studied sound engineering -> apprenticeship to microwave engineering and networking
- "doesn't think training is a good substitute for throwing oneself into the deep end"
- imposter sydrome inspires him to improve
- even experts can be taught
- on consulting, adaptability is the most important part
	- know your limits, but don't be afraid to push past them

- retired CEO
- 4 year degree, then MBA
- company clerk in Vietnam
- consultant for "Big 6" (modern day its big 4)
- degree got him in the door
- don't have to be pilot to run an airline, but do have to surround yourself with those types of people
- perhaps you shouldn't be [an SME] to run a company, because you fall in love with the tech


Embrace Failure
- Edison was not discouragd by all of the failure, but embraced it as closer to the answer.
- when you hit a rough spot in your career
	- view what's similar between the companies
	- is the same thing between the companies...you?
	- do you have behaviors that are not conducive to a successful career?
	- then fix them

Prepare for Change
- story: https://www.uh.edu/engines/epi1495.htm -- The Chauffeur Problem
- this once desirable job is no longer all that special
- so the special position we're in now...prepare to stay ahead of the curve
- "knowledge is power, but it's temporary power"


Be patient.
- companies take forever to make decisions sometimes
	- they operate at a different velocity than we do in our individual lives

Be self-aware
- even when you're a 20+ yr veteran, self-awareness can still be painful

There is no right way; there is no wrong way.
Our industry will continue to evolve--how infosec is applied will also continue to evolve
Success requires regular re-evaluation

The Bus Story
- Imagine you get on a bus
- you're going somwhere
- then realize you're going somewhere
- what you don't do is get off and wait for th ebus to come back
- you get off, and try to go somewhere
- or re-evaluate: is where you are actually a better place than where you were originally going?


Even sysadmins have imposter syndrome because they're viewed as "not real computer scientists".
Surround yourself with people smarter than you.
